# Optuna example
This is an example, that shows basic usage of optuna. It shows you how to apply conditional branching
and also evaluation with an existing study.

I commited the `scikit-learn-study.db`, so you can perform the evaluation without having to perform the optimize step firs

## Installation
to install the dependencies, you can create a new conda environment, by entering:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
